***Simone Cremonesi, Owner of AMTR&D:***
>“Before we met Mr Pasquinucci, our development was based basically on experimental tests. He showed us the potential of the Simulation based Design and under his  >teachings and suggestions, in very few months, we had the opportunity to learn Computation Fluid Dynamics  and perform several simulations with a huge progress of >the development of the new project.” 
 
***Federico Monterosso, Owner of Omiq S.R.L :***
>"I had the chance to collaborate with Carlo a couple of years  ago. I was very impressed by his professionalism and >dedication to the project we were working on. >His  technical skills, specifically in the use of CAESES but also in general on shape optimisation, resulted in a  very >successful project.”
